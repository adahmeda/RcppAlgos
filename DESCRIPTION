Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'
    for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics.
    There is a combination function and a permutation function that are
    both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and memory.
    There are optional constraint parameters that when utilized, generate
    all combinations/permutations of a vector meeting a specific criteria
    (E.g. finding all combinations such that the sum is less than a
    bound). Both functions are capable of handling mulitsets as well.
    Additionally, there are several highly efficient number theoretic 
    functions that are useful for problems common in computational
    mathematics. These include various sieving functions that can quickly
    generate the following: prime numbers, number of coprime elements, 
    number of divisors, prime factorizations, and complete factorizations.
    The primeSieve function implements the segmented sieve of 
    Eratosthenes with wheel factorization. It is capable of generating
    all primes less than a billion in under 2 seconds and 10 billion in
    less than 20 seconds. It can also quickly generate prime numbers
    over a range (E.g. primeSieve(10^13, 10^13+10^9)). There is a 
    stand-alone general factoring function as well as a prime 
    factorization function that implements a non-gmp variant of Pollard's
    rho algorithm (original source code found here: https://gmplib.org/).
